# LifeStat_Logger
Some scripts to extract data from daily activity trackers and to carry out analysis to find trends.

Currently, analysis will be largely carried out in MATLAB, with python powering the pre-processing pipeline.


### MySleepBot_Utils
Having built-in functionalies to automatically download and parse data from MySleepBot.com is just too much work - especially considering they have a "download .csv file" option (maybe for future implementation?). So my utility functions will start with a downloaded csv file!


# Some ideas for next step
Have an easy to use python script to track a few data-points at daily intervals for trend analysis
